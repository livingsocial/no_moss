# no_moss

Provides a means of defining object role APIs that should be consistent
between test subjects (objects under test) and test doubles (AKA mock
objects).

A role provides data that can be used to verify that a test subject
implements the role API. A role also provides a wrapper around a
test double that prevents unsupported interactions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'no_moss'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install no_moss

## Usage

Define a Role API using the NoMoss.define_role method as follows:

    PersonRole = NoMoss.define_role do
      implements :id, :name, :email
    end

Identify any of a role API's methods not implemented by an object
(usually for unit testing purposes) using the role's
unimplemented_methods_of method as follows:

    PersonRole.unimplemented_methods_of(object)

Define a Role-restricted proxy to a test subject (object under
test) or a test double (AKA mock object) as follows:

    PersonRole.restrict(test_double)
